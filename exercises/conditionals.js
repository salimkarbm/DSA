// 1. Write an if...else statement that:
//     • prints "even" if the number is an even number
//     • prints "odd" if the number is an odd number
// Hint: Use the % (modulus) operator to determine if a number is even or odd. The modulus operater takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second one:
// console.log(12 % 3);
// console.log(10 % 4);
// Result:
// 0
// 2
// The answer for 12 % 3 is 0 because twelve divided by three has no remainder. 10 % 4 is 2 because ten divided by 4 has a remainder of two.
// Make sure to test your code with different values. For example:
//     • If number equals 1, then odd should be printed to the console.
//     • If number equals 12, then even should be printed to the console.

// 2. Musical groups have special names based on the number of people in the group. For example, a "quartet" is a musical group with four musicians. Barbershop quartets were a popular type of quartet in the early 1900s and featured four singers made up of a lead, tenor, baritone, and bass.
// Directions:
// Write a series of conditional statements that:
//     • Prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
//     • Prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1
//     • Prints "duet" if musicians is equal to 2
//     • Prints "trio" if musicians is equal to 3
//     • Prints "quartet" if musicians is equal to 4
//     • Prints "this is a large group" if musicians is greater than 4
// TIP: Test your code with different values. For example,

// 3. For this quiz, you're going to help solve a fictitious murder mystery that happened at Stutern! A murder mystery is a game typically played at parties wherein one of the partygoers is secretly, and unknowingly, playing a murderer, and the other attendees must determine who among them is the criminal. It's a classic case of whodunnit.
// Since this might be your first time playing a murder mystery, we've simplified things quite a bit to make it easier. Here's what we know! In this murder mystery there are:
//     • four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,
//     • four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,
//     • and four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
// We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...
//     • the poison belongs to the ballroom,
//     • the trophy belongs to the gallery,
//     • the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
//     • and the knife belongs to the dining room.
// And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.
//     • Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
//     • Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
//     • Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
//     • Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.
// To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:
//     1. sets the value of weapon based on the room and
//     2. sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
// Afterwards, use this template to print a message to the console if the mystery was solved:
// __________ did it in the __________ with the __________!
// What goes into the three blank spaces? You can fill in the blanks with the name of the suspect, the room, and the weapon! For example, an output string may look like:
// Mr. Parkes did it in the dining room with the knife!
// Be sure to watch out for any extra or missing characters (including spaces and punctuation marks) in your output string as well!
// TIP: Test your code with different values. For example,
// If room equals gallery and suspect equals Ms. Van Cleve, then Ms. Van Cleve did it in the gallery with the trophy! should be printed to the console.

// 4. Checking your balance
// Using the flowchart below, write the code to represent checking your balance at the ATM. The yellow diamonds represent conditional statements and the blue rectangles with rounded corners represent what should be printed to the console.

// Use the following variables in your solution:
//     • balance - the account balance
//     • isActive - if account is active
//     • checkBalance - if you want to check balance
// Hint: The variable balance could be a value less than, greater than, or equal to 0. The variables isActive and checkBalance are booleans that can be set to true or false.
// TIP: To print out the account balance with decimal points (i.e. 325.00), use the .toFixed() method and pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. For example, balance.toFixed(2) returns 325.00.

// TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

// If checkBalance equals true and isActive equals false, then Your account is no longer active. should be printed to the console.

// 6. What do i wear?
// If you're like me, finding the right size t-shirt can sometimes be a challenge. What size am I? What's the difference between S (small), M (medium), and L (large)? I usually wear L, but what if I need an XL (extra large)?
// Thankfully, our friends at Teespring have got us covered because they've created a sizing chart to make things a lot easier.

// Directions:
// Use the sizing chart above, create a series of logical expressions that prints the size of a t-shirt based on the measurements of shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. Valid sizes include S, M, L, XL, 2XL, and 3XL.
// For example, if...
// var shirtWidth = 23; // size L (large)
// var shirtLength = 30; // size L (large)
// var shirtSleeve = 8.71; // size L (large)

// Then print L to the console.
// Hint: You will need to compare a range of values when checking for shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. For example, if the shirt's width is at least 20", but no more than 22", then the t-shirt should be medium (M) — as long as the other values for the shirt's length and sleeve measurements match up.

// If shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve don't fit within the range of acceptable values for a specific size, then print NA to the console. For example, if...
// var shirtWidth = 18; // size S (small)
// var shirtLength = 29; // size M (medium)
// var shirtSleeve = 8.47; // size M (medium)

// Then print N/A to the console because the measurements don't all match up with one particular size.
// TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,
// If shirtWidth equals 19, shirtLength equals 28 and shirtSleeve equals 8.21, then S should be printed to the console.
// If shirtWidth equals 26, shirtLength equals 33 and shirtSleeve equals 9.63, then 2XL should be printed to the console.
// If shirtWidth equals 18, shirtLength equals 29 and shirtSleeve equals 8.47, then NA should be printed to the console.
